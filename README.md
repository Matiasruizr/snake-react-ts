# Snake Game omn React + TypeScript + Vite

## What is Snake?
Snake is a casual game where a sole player attempts to eat food (represented in shapes/object) by running into them with the head of the snake.
Each object eaten makes the snake longer, so maneuvering is progressively more difficult.

The concept of the game originated from the 1976 arcade game Blockade.

## How to play?
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
- Eat the food to grow the snake.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body.

## How to run?
- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
